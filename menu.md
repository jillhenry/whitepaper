## Background
- Regional network blockades
- Traditional centralized CDN services have great optimization potential for cost and efficiency
- Distributed network technology matures
- In recent years, the blockchain and cryptocurrency technology have made rapid development
- Users can participate in blockchain network collaboration even if they are not tech-savvy

## Summary

The Vision Network is a distributed extensible virtual network, based on the physical network layer and the ISP network layer.

The Vision Network is based on blockchain technology, which provides distributed services such as VPN, CDN, DNS, and DDoS defense. The VNET Token with stable value scale will be used in the ecology and produce an incentive effect. Everyone can participate in distributed network construction. We believe the Vision Network, a distributed Internet infrastructure will make the Internet more open, more equal, more stable, more efficient, safer and freer.

## Our Philosophy: Yearning for freedom

Free, open, equal, and shared are not just personal values and ideological preferences. These things are written in the basic protocols of the Internet and are the inevitable results of the design of early talents. A network can be as big as it is today, and there is no central government, no parliament and political bureau, not ideological and administrative relations at work, but a series of basic communication protocols.

An e-mail which is came from Microsoft can be sent to Gmail, because there are many intermediate servers that carry the delivery task. This delivery is neither a business task nor an administrative task. It does not bring direct commercial benefits. There is any administrative affiliation. The existence of this open network, just because if you want to participate in this game, you must accept these open game rules.

The giants on the Internet, such as Google and Facebook, are not the beneficiaries of the open architecture of the Internet. Whether it is from Pratt & Whitney, or from the perspective of providing more business opportunities, the open and free Internet spirit will really benefit us.

Perhaps not everyone agrees with these viewpoints. In some areas, for some reasons, ISP services are more like a large local area network. They are not as interconnected and open-minded as the original design of the Internet. As a group of technology geeks, although we can understand it, but we are more and more looking forward to enjoying an Internet infrastructure that is exactly the same as the original design, free, open, equal, and shared.

Same like you, our team members also need accessibility, stable and fluent network communication services, explore the world through Google and Wikipedia, share our work and life times with friends all over the world on Facebook/Instagram, Using YouTube / Twitter to see a colorful world, you and us, can not only understand the latest technological trends, academic research, cutting-edge information, but also freely communicate, discuss and collaborate.

The Internet belongs to all those who construct and use it. The future of the Internet should not be abducted and controlled by any centralized organization. The billions of people who use and participate in the Internet, and the experts who construct and maintain the Internet, they all should have the rights of freely browsing and speaking.

We are taking some actions to create a distributed, borderless, and accessible future network infrastructure through a series of technologies and standards to provide the basis for user mutual assistance services, including not only the most basic interconnection services, but also expect to build secure and shareable computing, storage and other services through either mature or innovative technology methods.

Of course, all of this, starting from barrier-free interconnection, expects your blessings and support, and welcomes the participation of all people with ideals to build a healthy basic ecological environment.
